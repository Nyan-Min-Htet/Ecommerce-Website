                <p>When you shop for plants, garden and birding supplies at Spring Hill, you join generations of gardeners who have counted on Spring Hill for products that perform beautifully.</p>
                <p>Our company began in 1849 when Peter Bohlender, a Bavarian immigrant, started a small nursery in North Dayton, Ohio. Bohlender moved his nursery to Tipp City, Ohio in 1889, and later renamed it Spring Hill Nurseries. He derived the name from the hill located across the creek from the present day nursery.</p>

                <p>Originally a wholesale nursery business, Spring Hill Nurseries slowly moved out of wholesale and into mail-order. Spring Hill shifted the majority of its focus to mail-order in 1930.</p>
                <p>Throughout the years, generations of gardeners enjoyed receiving the colorful spring and fall catalogs that featured unusual and exquisite plants. Our plants can be found in gardens throughout the country.</p>

                <p>Today, Spring Hill continues to operate in Tipp City. Our team of researchers and horticulturists devote their time to finding new and exciting plants that'll perform in gardens throughout the country. Our garden team visits plant breeders, universities, public gardens and trade shows to find plants that perform well and will make your garden look its best. We also maintain test gardens where we trial many new varieties.</p>
                <p>To bring you the newest and best choice of plants, we recently moved our operations from a catalog-based operation to a primarily web-based one. Our website enables us to show many more offerings--and immediately update you about new plants. We still offer limited print publications.
